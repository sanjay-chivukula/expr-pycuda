# PyCUDA Experiments:
This repository contains notes and code of my experiments and learning with
 PyCUDA.

Note:   
If you are using pycuda with pycharm(Ubuntu) you may get an error saying
 missing nvcc, even though you installed it properly and it works in terminal
 . You can fix this by adding the right PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables in
  project run and debug configurations.

## Leaning PyCUDA:
Am following "Hands-On GPU Programming with Python and CUDA" by Dr.&nbsp;Brian
&nbsp;Tuomanen for learning PyCUDA. These projects below are in sequence
 according to the exercises and samples from the book.  
<ol>
<li> [Device Query](./device-query/readme.md) </li>
<li> [Basic Data Transfer](./data-transfer/readme.md) </li>
<li> [Basic Arithmetic Operations](./arithmetic-operations/readme.md) </li>
<li> [Speed Test](./speed-test/readme.md) </li>
